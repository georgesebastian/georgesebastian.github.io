=========================

Fooling around trying to make my website. I just started my foray into web development using HTML, CSS and of course JavaScript. I will try to make it into a WebApp over the course of time but for starters, we shall try with designing and placeholders for all the data. Credit for motivation go to Addy Osmani et al who started the Yeoman scaffolding project (yeoman.io). Also thanks to John Resig's "Write code every day" pdf/blog/rant, I shall try my best to add something to this everyday.  (John Resig, the creator of jQuery. Kudos)
